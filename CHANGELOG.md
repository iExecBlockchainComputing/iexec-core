## [[3.0.1]](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-core/releases/tag/3.0.1) 2019-05-22

This release is a patch to fix an issue following the release of version 3.0.0.

When asking for a replicate, a worker sends the latest available block number from the node it is is connected to.
If that node is a little bit behind the node the core is connected to, the worker will have a disadvantage compare to
workers connected to more up-to-date nodes.
To avoid this disadvantage, now the core waits for a few blocks before sending replicates to workers.

## [[3.0.0]](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-core/releases/tag/3.0.0) 2019-05-15

This release contains the core set of changes in the 3.0.0-alpha-X releases and some other features/fixes.
In summary this version introduces:

* A new architecture: the core has been completely re-architectured from the version 2.
* Latest PoCo use.
* Better management of transaction with the ethereum blockchain.
* Failover mechanisms: in case some workers are lost or restarted when working on a specific task, internal mechanisms
  will redistribute the task or use as much as possible the work performed by the lost / restarted workers.
* iExec End-To-End Encryption with Secret Management Service (SMS): from this version, inputs and outputs of the job can
  be fully encrypted using the Secret Management Service.
* Decentralized oracle: If the result is needed by a smart contract, it is available directly on the blockchain.
* IPFS: data can be retrieved from IPFS and public results can be published on IPFS.

For further information on this version, please read our documentation.

## [[3.0.0-alpha3]](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-core/releases/tag/3.0.0-alpha3) 2019-04-15
